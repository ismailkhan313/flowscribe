... and then there's mastery, which, uh, you know, is, uh, you know, which is, uh, really for specialization. Classically, the final book studied in a, in a Hanafi madrasa would be the Hidayah of al-Marghinani. The Hanafis had a love relationship with this book. Um... they said, some even wrote poetry. A lot of, there was a lot of poetry written in praise of the Hidayah., "The Hidayah, like the Quran, abrogated what came before it in sacred law of books." Um, . "So study it and memorize it, and your, and your words will be f- will be protected from error and from stumbling and from deviance." Um, and some said, . "Whoever misses out on the Hidayah has missed out on Hidayah, on guidance." But that's overstatement, of course. And Haskafi's Dur al-Mukhtar, uh, Imam Marghinani's Hidayah is based on, uh, uh, understanding the legal reasoning of the school. Uh, so it's, this is called the Tariqatul Tafakkuha. Um, Imam Haskafi's Dur al-Mukhtar is Tariqatul Fatwa. Right? It's focused on understanding what's the fatwa in the school and the legal details. And in fiqh, there are these two approaches to fiqh, right? There's the legal understanding and there's the legal a- application. Right? So the faqih can be seen as the one who has legal understanding, but the, but the mufti is the one who has a capacity to apply the law. And sometimes the one applying the law is not that interested in, in what's the theoretical underpinning about it, uh, the reasoning behind this. He said, "Look, I need to answer people's questions. Just leave me alone." And then the, and the faqih often is just interested in the, "Well, theoretically, this is, this is how things are." So there's... and ideally, you know, someone would have both, right? But some minds are more... i- inclined towards legal reasoning and the theoretical. Others are more inclined towards the practical. And in Shafi'i fiqh, the Minhaj of Imam Nawawi and its commentaries, such as Sharh al-Mahalli, which is arguably the greatest commentary on the Minhaj when it comes to the legal reasoning aspect, and there's other great commentaries on, on the Minhaj. Um... and at this, at this level, works are studied on usul al-ifta, on the principles of fatwa. Um, and there's other derivative sciences related to fiqh, such as qawaid ul-, um, such as, um, um, qawaid ul-fiqh, the legal maxims, et cetera. There's many, um, you know, specialized things that could be studied separately, and, um... but, but, you know, this is just to understand the core emphasis.
