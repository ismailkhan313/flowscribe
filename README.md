# Nasikh Nexus

In Arabic, Nasikh (ناسخ) is the active participle of the verb nasakha (نسخ), which means "to copy," "to transcribe," or "to write down." A Nasikh is literally a "scribe," "copier," or "transcriber."

A "nexus" is a central point or a connection that links two or more things. It signifies a core, a hub, or a focal point where different elements converge.

In other worsd, Nasikh Nexus can translated to The Scribe's Hub or The Central Point of Transcription. It implies this project is the central connection point for all scribal tasks, seamlessly handling both the auditory and visual-to-text conversion. The name is sophisticated, technically relevant, and honors the Arabic-centric nature of its OCR capabilities.

Nasikh Nexus is a powerful toolkit designed for processing Classical Arabic (Fusha) content into English. It leverages state-of-the-art AI models to provide high-accuracy audio transcription and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for scanned documents and manuscripts.

The project integrates OpenAI Whisper for robust speech-to-text and Mistral AI for precise OCR on Arabic texts.
